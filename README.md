# Evaluate-KNN-Model-Performance
The KNN algorithm is a popular machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. 

In this particular code snippet, the KNN model has already been trained using a set of labeled data. The purpose of the snippet is to assess the model's performance by computing its accuracy on the training data. 

To evaluate the accuracy, the snippet likely utilizes a test dataset containing known labels. It passes this test dataset to the trained KNN model and compares the predicted labels with the actual labels. By comparing the predictions against the ground truth, the snippet calculates the accuracy score of the KNN model.

The accuracy score represents the proportion of correctly predicted labels out of the total number of samples in the training dataset. It is a commonly used metric to evaluate the performance of classification models. A higher accuracy score indicates a more accurate model, while a lower score suggests that the model's predictions are less reliable.

Overall, this code snippet provides a means to assess the performance of a KNN model on the training data, allowing developers and data scientists to gauge the effectiveness of their model and make any necessary adjustments if required.
